RayFire for Unity FAQ.

1. 
Q.  Why I can't demolish objects which I have as FBX asset.
A.  Turn On Read/Write Enabled property in Import Settings.

-------------------------------------------------------------

2. 
Q.  How to apply different material for inner fragments surface?
A.  Both Shatter and Rigid components have Material group of properties.
    You can set your custom material for fragment's inner surface in Inner Material field.

-------------------------------------------------------------

3. 
Q.  Why copy/pasted in Edit Mode component doesn't work as it should in Play mode?
A.  Do not copy/paste initialized components or components which allows to Setup them and cache some specific data. 
    Also do not copy Rigid component if it is Connected Cluster with cached connections. 
    Instead use Copy Component, Add new component and then use Paste Components Values.

4. 
Q.  Why my Connectivity setup collapses immediately at Start?
A.  Connectivity setup works only with Inactive and Kinematic fragments and need at least one Unyielding fragment.
    With Mesh object type Unyielding fragment can be defined in Rigid/Activation properties. 
    With Mesh Root object type you need to use Unyielding component on the same root object, 
    it's gizmo should overlap some fragments usually at the bottom of structure. 
    All fragments will check for connection with Unyielding fragments through other fragments.

5. 
Q.  Why my fragments explodes immediately at Start?
A.  This happens when fragments colliders overlap with each other. 
    At Start they start pushing each other and cause explosive simulation.
    Make sure that fragmented object doesn't have interpenetrated elements.
    Also, in some cases mesh has no interpenetration, 
    but fragments collider may have because dynamic colliders are always convex.
